# Klaviyo Swift Examples

## Overview

This repository includes a few sample apps that demonstrate how to integrate the Klaviyo Swift SDK into your app. We will update this repo as we make new releases and add new features to the Swift SDK.

## Cocoapods Example

This [example](CocoapodsExample) shows to create an app that integrates the Klaviyo Swift via cocoapods. There is a sample podfile which specifies the Swift SDK as a dependency. If your app uses Cocoapods you would add a similar dependency to your Podfile and run:

```bash
pod install
```

## SPM Example

This [example](SPMExample) demonstrates how to integrate our SDK using SPM. Follow the steps [here](Link to swift SDK instructions) to integrate it in your app.
