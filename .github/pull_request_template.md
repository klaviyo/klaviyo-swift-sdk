## Release/Versioning Considerations
<!-- Help determine how this should be categorized for release, add additional notes below. -->
- [ ] `Patch` Contains internal changes or backwards-compatible bug fixes.
- [ ] `Minor` Contains changes to the public API.
- [ ] `Major` Contains **breaking** changes.
- [ ] Contains readme or migration guide changes.
