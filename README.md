## Overview

The Klaviyo Swift SDK allows developers to incorporate Klaviyo's analytics and push notification functionality into their iOS applications.
The SDK assists in identifying users and tracking events via [Klaviyo Client APIs](https://developers.klaviyo.com/en/reference/api_overview).
To reduce performance overhead, API requests are queued and sent in batches.
The queue is persisted to local storage so that data is not lost if the device is offline or the app is terminated.

Once integrated, your marketing team will be able to better understand your app users' needs and send them timely messages via APNs.

## Installation

1. Enable push notification capabilities in your Xcode project. The section "Enable the push notification capability" in this [Apple developer guide](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/registering_your_app_with_apns#2980170) provides detailed instructions.
2. If you intend to use [rich push notifications](#rich-push), [custom badge counts](#custom-badge-count), or [custom data](#custom-data), add a [Notification Service Extension](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/unnotificationserviceextension) to your Xcode project. A Notification Service Extension ships as a separate bundle inside your iOS app. To add this extension to your app:
   - Select File > New > Target in Xcode.
   - Select the Notification Service Extension target from the iOS > Application extension section.
   - Click Next.
   - Specify a name and other configuration details for your app extension.
   - Click Finish.

    > ⚠️ The deployment target of your notification service extension defaults to the latest iOS version.
             If this exceeds your app's minimum supported iOS version, push notifications may not display attached media on older devices.
             To avoid this, ensure the extension's minimum deployment target matches that of your app. ⚠️

    Set up an App Group between your main app target and your Notification Service Extension.
    - Select your main app target > Signing & Capabilities
    - Select + Capability (make sure it is set to All not Debug or Release) > App Groups
    - Create a new App Group based on the recommended naming scheme `group.[MainTargetBundleId].[descriptor]`
    - In your app's `Info.plist`, add a new entry for `klaviyo_app_group` as a String with the App Group name
    - Select your Notification Service Extension target > Signing & Capabilities
    - Add an App Group with the same name as the main target's App Group
    - In your Notification Service Extension's `Info.plist`, add a new entry for `klaviyo_app_group` as a String with the App Group name

3. Based on which dependency manager you use, follow the instructions below to install the Klaviyo's dependencies.

      <details>
      <summary>Swift Package Manager [Recommended]</summary>

      KlaviyoSwift and KlaviyoForms are available via [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager). Follow the steps below to install.

      1. Open your project and navigate to your project’s settings.
      2. Select the **Package Dependencies** tab and click on the **add** button below the packages list.
      3. Enter the URL of the Swift SDK repository `https://github.com/klaviyo/klaviyo-swift-sdk` in the text field. This should bring up the package on the screen.
      4. For the dependency rule dropdown select - **Up to Next Major Version** and leave the pre-filled versions as is.
      5. Click **Add Package**.
      6. On the next prompt, assign the package product `KlaviyoSwift` and `KlaviyoForms` to your app target and `KlaviyoSwiftExtension` to the notification service extension target (if one was created) and click **Add Package**.

      </details>

      <details>
      <summary>CocoaPods</summary>

      KlaviyoSwift is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/pods/KlaviyoSwift).

      1. To install, add the following lines to your Podfile. Be sure to replace `YourAppTarget` and `YourAppNotificationServiceExtenionTarget` with the names of your app and notification service extension targets respectively.

      ```ruby
      target 'YourAppTarget' do
        pod 'KlaviyoSwift'
      end

      target 'YourAppTarget' do
        pod 'KlaviyoForms'
      end

      target 'YourAppNotificationServiceExtenionTarget' do
        pod 'KlaviyoSwiftExtension'
      end
      ```
      2. Run `pod install` to complete the integration.
      The library can be kept up-to-date via `pod update KlaviyoSwift` and `pod update KlaviyoSwiftExtension`.
      </details>

4. Finally, in the `NotificationService.swift` file add the code for the two required delegates from [this](Examples/KlaviyoSwiftExamples/SPMExample/NotificationServiceExtension/NotificationService.swift) file.
  This sample covers calling into Klaviyo so that we can download and attach the media to the push notification as well as handle custom badge counts. It also demonstrates how to access custom data (key-value pairs) sent from Klaviyo.

> Advanced: If you are using multiple push sending providers, you can determine whether a message originated from Klaviyo by importing `KlaviyoSwift` and using the `isKlaviyoNotification` extension property on `UNNotifcationResponse`.

## Initialization
The SDK must be initialized with the short alphanumeric [public API key](https://help.klaviyo.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005062267#difference-between-public-and-private-api-keys1)
for your Klaviyo account, also known as your Site ID.

```swift
// AppDelegate

import KlaviyoSwift

class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {

    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
        KlaviyoSDK().initialize(with: "YOUR_KLAVIYO_PUBLIC_API_KEY")
        return true
    }
}
```

The SDK **should** be initialized before any other Klaviyo SDK methods are called.

## Profile Identification
The SDK provides methods to identify your users as Klaviyo profiles via the [Create Client Profile API](https://developers.klaviyo.com/en/reference/create_client_profile).
A profile can be identified by any combination of the following:

* External ID: A unique identifier used by customers to associate Klaviyo profiles with profiles in an external system, such as a point-of-sale system. Format varies based on the external system.
* Individual's email address
* Individual's phone number in [E.164 format](https://help.klaviyo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360046055671#h_01HE5ZYJEAHZKY6WZW7BAD36BG)

These above identifiers are persisted to local storage so that the SDK can keep track of the current user/profile for you when you make event requests or want to set a push token etc.

Profile identifiers can be set all at once or individually. Either way, the SDK will group and batch API calls to improve performance.

The following code demonstrates how to set profile identifiers:

```swift
// organization, title, image, location and additional properties (dictionary) can also be set using the below constructor
let profile = Profile(email: "junior@blob.com",  firstName: "Blob",  lastName: "Jr.")
KlaviyoSDK().set(profile: profile)

// or setting individual properties
KlaviyoSDK().set(profileAttribute: .firstName, value: "Blob")
KlaviyoSDK().set(profileAttribute: .lastName, value: "Jr.")
```

### Reset Profile
To start a new profile altogether (e.g. if a user logs out) either call `KlaviyoSDK().resetProfile()` to clear the currently tracked profile identifiers,
or use `KlaviyoSDK().set(profile: profile)` to overwrite it with a new profile object.

```swift
// start a profile for Blob Jr.
let profile = Profile(email: "junior@blob.com",  firstName: "Blob",  lastName: "Jr.")
KlaviyoSDK().set(profile: profile)

// stop tracking Blob Jr.
KlaviyoSDK().resetProfile()

// start a profile for Robin Hood
let profile = Profile(email: "robin@hood.com",  firstName: "Robin",  lastName: "Hood")
KlaviyoSDK().set(profile: profile)
```
### Anonymous Tracking Notice

Klaviyo will track unidentified users with an autogenerated ID whenever a push token is set or an event is created.
That way, you can collect push tokens and track events prior to collecting profile identifiers such as email or phone number.
When an identifier is provided, Klaviyo will merge the anonymous user with an identified user.

## Event tracking

The SDK provides tools for tracking events that users perform on your app via the [Create Client Event API](https://developers.klaviyo.com/en/reference/create_client_event).
Below is an example of how to track an event:

```swift
// using a predefined event name
let event = Event(name: .StartedCheckoutMetric,
                  properties: [
                        "name": "cool t-shirt",
                        "color": "blue",
                        "size": "medium",
                      ],
                  value: 166 )

KlaviyoSDK().create(event: event)

// using a custom event name
let customEvent = Event(name: .CustomEvent("Checkout Completed"),
                  properties: [
                        "name": "cool t-shirt",
                        "color": "blue",
                        "size": "medium",
                      ],
                  value: 166)

KlaviyoSDK().create(event: customEvent)
```

### Arguments

The `create` method takes an event object as an argument. The event can be constructed with the following arguments:
- [required] `name`: The name of the event you want to track, as a `EventName` enum. A list of common Klaviyo defined event metrics can be found in `Event.EventName`. You can also create custom events by using the `CustomEvent` enum case of `Event.EventName`
- `properties`: A dictionary of properties that are specific to the event. This argument is optional.
- `value`: A numeric value (`Double`) to associate with this event. For example, the dollar amount of a purchase.

## Push Notifications

### Prerequisites

* An apple developer [account](https://developer.apple.com/).
* Configure [iOS push notifications](https://help.klaviyo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360023213971) in Klaviyo account settings.

### Collecting Push Tokens

In order to send push notifications to your users, you must collect their push tokens and register them with Klaviyo.
This is done via the `KlaviyoSDK().set(pushToken:)` method, which registers a push token and current authorization state
via the [Create Client Push Token API](https://developers.klaviyo.com/en/reference/create_client_push_token).

* Call [`registerForRemoteNotifications()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiapplication/1623078-registerforremotenotifications)
to request a push token from APNs. This is typically done in the [`application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiapplicationdelegate/1622921-application) method of your app delegate.
* Implement the delegate method [`application:didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsapplicationdelegate/1428766-application)
in your application delegate to receive the push token from APNs and register it with Klaviyo.

Below is the code to do both of the above steps:
```swift
import KlaviyoSwift

func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    KlaviyoSDK().initialize(with: "YOUR_KLAVIYO_PUBLIC_API_KEY")

    UIApplication.shared.registerForRemoteNotifications()

    return true
}

func application(_ application: UIApplication, didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken deviceToken: Data) {
    KlaviyoSDK().set(pushToken: deviceToken)
}
```

### Request Push Notification Permission

Once the push token is obtained, the next step is to request permission from your users to send them push notifications.
You can add the permission request code anywhere in your application where it makes sense to prompt users for this permission.
Apple provides some [guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/asking_permission_to_use_notifications)
on the best practices for when and how to ask for this permission. The following example demonstrates how to request push permissions
within the [`application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiapplicationdelegate/1622921-application)
method in the application delegate file. However, it's worth noting that this may not be the ideal location as it could interrupt the app's startup experience.

After setting a push token, the Klaviyo SDK will automatically track changes to
the user's notification permission whenever the application is opened or resumed from the background.

Below is example code to request push notification permission:
```swift
import UserNotifications

func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    KlaviyoSDK().initialize(with: "YOUR_KLAVIYO_PUBLIC_API_KEY")

    UIApplication.shared.registerForRemoteNotifications()

    let center = UNUserNotificationCenter.current()
    center.delegate = self as? UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate // the type casting can be removed once the delegate has been implemented
    let options: UNAuthorizationOptions = [.alert, .sound, .badge]
    // use the below options if you are interested in using provisional push notifications. Note that using this will not
    // show the push notifications prompt to the user.
    // let options: UNAuthorizationOptions = [.alert, .sound, .badge, .provisional]
    center.requestAuthorization(options: options) { granted, error in
        if let error = error {
            // Handle the error here.
            print("error = ", error)
        }

        // Irrespective of the authorization status call `registerForRemoteNotifications` here so that
        // the `didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken` delegate is called. Doing this
        // will make sure that Klaviyo always has the latest push authorization status.
            DispatchQueue.main.async {
                UIApplication.shared.registerForRemoteNotifications()
            }
    }

    return true
}
```

### Receiving Push Notifications

#### Tracking Open Events

When a user taps on a push notification, Implement  [`userNotificationCenter:didReceive:withCompletionHandler`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/unusernotificationcenterdelegate/1649501-usernotificationcenter)
and [`userNotificationCenter:willPresent:withCompletionHandler`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/unusernotificationcenterdelegate/1649518-usernotificationcenter) in your application delegate to handle receiving push notifications
when the app is in the background and foreground respectively.

Below is an example of how to handle push notifications in your app delegate:
```swift
// be sure to set the UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate to self in the didFinishLaunchingWithOptions method (refer the requesting push notification permission section above for more details on this)
extension AppDelegate: UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate {
    // below method will be called when the user interacts with the push notification
    func userNotificationCenter(
        _ center: UNUserNotificationCenter,
        didReceive response: UNNotificationResponse,
        withCompletionHandler completionHandler: @escaping () -> Void) {
        // If this notification is Klaviyo's notification we'll handle it
        // else pass it on to the next push notification service to which it may belong
        let handled = KlaviyoSDK().handle(notificationResponse: response, withCompletionHandler: completionHandler)
        if !handled {
            completionHandler()
        }
    }

    // below method is called when the app receives push notifications when the app is the foreground
    func userNotificationCenter(
        _ center: UNUserNotificationCenter,
        willPresent notification: UNNotification,
        withCompletionHandler completionHandler: @escaping (UNNotificationPresentationOptions) -> Void) {
        if #available(iOS 14.0, *) {
            completionHandler([.list, .banner])
        } else {
            completionHandler([.alert])
        }
    }
}
```

>  ℹ️ To ensure that push notifications are handled properly when they contain deep links (via a custom URL scheme or via a universal link), please refer to the [Deep Linking](#deep-linking) section below.

Once your first push notifications are sent and opened, you should start to see _Opened Push_ metrics within your Klaviyo dashboard.

#### Rich Push

>  ℹ️ Rich push notifications are supported in SDK version [2.2.0](https://github.com/klaviyo/klaviyo-swift-sdk/releases/tag/2.2.0) and higher

[Rich Push](https://help.klaviyo.com/hc/en-us/articles/16917302437275) is the ability to add images to push notification messages.  Once the steps
in the [Installation](#installation) section are complete, you should have a notification service extension in your
project setup with the code from the `KlaviyoSwiftExtension`. Below are instructions on how to test rich push notifications.

##### Testing rich push notifications

* To test rich push notifications, you will need three things:
  * Any push notifications tester like Apple's official [push notification console](https://developer.apple.com/notifications/push-notifications-console/) or a third party software such as [this](https://github.com/onmyway133/PushNotifications).
* A push notification payload that resembles what Klaviyo would send to you. The below payload should work as long as the image is valid:

```json
{
  "aps": {
    "alert": {
      "title": "Sample title for a Klaviyo push notification",
      "body": "Sample body for a Klaviyo push notification"
    },
    "mutable-content": 1
  },
  "rich-media": "https://picsum.photos/200/300.jpg",
  "rich-media-type": "jpg"
}
```
  * A real device's push notification token. This can be printed out to the console from the `didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken` method in `AppDelegate`.

Once you have these three things, you can then use the push notifications tester and send a local push notification to make sure that everything was set up correctly.

#### Badge Count
>  ℹ️ Setting or incrementing the badge count is available in SDK version [4.1.0](https://github.com/klaviyo/klaviyo-swift-sdk/releases/tag/4.1.0) and higher

Klaviyo supports setting or incrementing the badge count when you send a push notification. For this functionality to work, you must set up the Notification Service Extension and an App Group as outlined under the [Installation](#installation) section.

##### Autoclearing

By default, the Klaviyo SDK automatically clears the badge count on app open. If you want to disable this behavior, add a new entry for `klaviyo_badge_autoclearing` as a Boolean set to `NO` in your app's `Info.plist`. You can re-enable automatically clearing badges by setting this value to `YES`.

##### Handling Other Badging Sources

Klaviyo SDK will automatically handle the badge count associated with Klaviyo pushes. If you need to manually update the badge count to account for other notification sources, use the `KlaviyoSDK().setBadgeCount(:)` method, which will update the badge count and keep it in sync with the Klaviyo SDK. This method should be used instead of (rather than in addition to) setting the badge count using `UNUserNotificationCenter` and/or `UIApplication` methods.

#### Silent Push Notifications

Silent push notifications (also known as background pushes) allow your app to receive payloads from Klaviyo without displaying a visible alert to the user. These are typically used to trigger background behavior, such as displaying content, personalizing the app interface, or downloading new information from a server.
>  ℹ️ Silent push support is available by default. The Klaviyo SDK does not provide specific handling for silent push notifications. See [enable the remote notifications capability](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/pushing-background-updates-to-your-app#Enable-the-remote-notifications-capability) and [receive background notifications](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/pushing-background-updates-to-your-app#Enable-the-remote-notifications-capability) for more details.

To handle silent push notifications in your app, you'll need to implement the appropriate delegate methods yourself. Here's an example of how to handle silent push notifications:

```
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didReceiveRemoteNotification userInfo: [AnyHashable : Any], fetchCompletionHandler completionHandler: @escaping (UIBackgroundFetchResult) -> Void) {
  // Access custom key-value pairs from the top level
  if let customData = userInfo["key_value_pairs"] as? [String: String] {
    // Process your custom key-value pairs here
    for (key, value) in kvPairs {
        print("Key: \(key), Value: \(value)")
    }
  } else {
      print("No key_value_pairs found in notification")
  }
}
```

>  ℹ️ Silent push notifications are not supported by the iOS simulator. To test silent push notifications, please use a real device.

#### Custom Data
Klaviyo messages can also include key-value pairs (custom data) for both standard and silent push notifications. You can access these key-value pairs using the `key_value_pairs` key on the [`userInfo`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsnotification/1409222-userinfo) dictionary associated with the notification (for silent pushes, see the example above; for standard pushes, see [`NotificationService.swift`](https://github.com/klaviyo/klaviyo-swift-sdk/blob/master/Examples/KlaviyoSwiftExamples/SPMExample/NotificationServiceExtension/NotificationService.swift) in the example app). This enables you to extract additional information from the push payload and handle it appropriately - for instance, by triggering background processing, logging analytics events, or dynamically updating app content.

## Deep Linking

[Deep Links](https://help.klaviyo.com/hc/en-us/articles/14750403974043) allow you to navigate to a particular page within your app in response to the user opening a push notification, tapping on a link on an In-App Form, or by tapping on a universal link from outside of the app. The Klaviyo Swift SDK supports deep linking using either URL schemes or universal links.

### Adding link-handling logic

We recommend that your create a helper method to contain the link handling logic. This may include parsing a URL into its components, using those components to navigate to the appropriate screen in the app. By encapsulating this logic within a helper method, you can centralize your logic and reduce duplication of code as you complete the rest of your deep linking setup via [url schemes](#handling-url-schemes) and [universal links](#handling-universal-links).

As an example, you may add a method like the following within your `AppDelegate` or `SceneDelegate`:

```swift
func handleDeepLink(url: URL) {
    // parse the URL into its components by creating a URLComponents object; i.e.,
    // let components = URLComponents(url: url, resolvingAgainstBaseURL: true)

    // extract the path and/or the query items from the URL components

    // use your app's navigation logic to handle routing to the appropriate
    // screen given the extracted path and/or query items
}
```

### Handling URL Schemes

>  ℹ️  Your app needs to use version 1.7.2 at a minimum in order for the below steps to work.

URL schemes are a simple way to enable deep linking in your app. Here's how to set them up:

#### Step 1: Register the URL scheme

First, you need to register your URL scheme with iOS. This tells the operating system that your app can handle URLs with that scheme. For detailed instructions, please see ["Register your URL scheme"](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/defining-a-custom-url-scheme-for-your-app#Register-your-URL-scheme) in Apple's official documentation.

#### Step 2: Whitelist Your URL Scheme

Next, you need to whitelist your URL scheme in your app's `Info.plist` file. This allows your app to open deep links from push notifications.

To do this, add the following to your `Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
<array>
    <string>{your_url_scheme}</string>
</array>
```

Replace `{your_url_scheme}` with the URL scheme you registered in Step 1.

#### Step 3: Handle the deep links in your app

Finally, you need to add code to your app to process incoming URLs and navigate to the correct content. The implementation differs depending on whether your app uses SwiftUI or UIKit for its lifecycle.

##### For SwiftUI Apps

If your app uses the SwiftUI app life cycle, you should use the [`onOpenURL(perform:)`](<https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/onopenurl(perform:)>) view modifier. Attach the modifier to the root view in your main App scene.

```swift
@main
struct MyApplication: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
                .onOpenURL { url in
                // handle the URL
                // if you created a helper method (see "Adding link-handling logic", above), call it here
            }
        }
    }
}
```

##### For UIKit Apps

If your app uses the UIKit app life cycle, you will handle incoming URLs in your `SceneDelegate` or `AppDelegate`.

For detailed instructions and code examples for the UIKit approach, please refer to Apple's official documentation: [Handling incoming URLs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/defining-a-custom-url-scheme-for-your-app#Handle-incoming-URLs)

### Handling Universal Links

>  ℹ️  Full trackable universal links support is available in SDK version 5.1.0 and higher

Klaviyo supports embedding trackable [universal links](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/supporting-universal-links-in-your-app) in email campaigns. To ensure universal links are properly tracked as profile events *and* your app opens and processes the links correctly, you need to configure your app to handle them. At a high level, the process works like this:

1.  A marketer includes a universal link in a Klaviyo email. Klaviyo automatically wraps it in a unique, trackable URL, which we call a **universal tracking link**.
2.  When a user clicks the link on a device with your app installed, iOS delivers the wrapped link to your application.
3.  Your app passes this universal tracking link to the Klaviyo SDK by calling the `handleUniversalTrackingLink(_:)` method.
4.  The SDK records a click event on the user's profile, and unwraps the universal tracking link into the *original* universal link.
5.  The SDK then processes the original link in one of two ways:
    * **Preferred:** It's passed to a custom deep link handler you register with the SDK. This gives you full control over the navigation logic.
    * **Fallback:** It's passed back to your `AppDelegate` or `SceneDelegate`, invoking the logic you've written there to handle URLs.

Note that the instructions below will also enable your app to handle standard universal links (i.e., links that are not Klaviyo universal tracking links)

#### Setup

Follow these steps to configure your app to handle Klaviyo universal links.

> ⚠️ Note that these instructions diverge somewhat from [Apple's developer documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/supporting-universal-links-in-your-app) on supporting universal links.

#### Step 1: Configure Universal Links in your Klaviyo account
Follow our guide on [setting up universal links](<TODO: link to universal linking documentation>) in your Klaviyo account dashboard.

#### Step 2: Add the Associated Domains Entitlement
Follow Apple's developer documentation to [add the associated domains entitlement to your app](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/supporting-associated-domains#Add-the-associated-domains-entitlement-to-your-app).

You must add the universal link domain you configured in step 1. The domain should be prefixed with `applinks:`; for example:

`applinks:mycompany.com`

#### Step 3: **(Recommended)** Register a Deep Link Handler
Registering a handler provides a reliable, centralized place to manage incoming links from Klaviyo and simplifies your app's logic.

Registering a handler tells the Klaviyo SDK how to handle deep links. Although we have a fallback mechanism in case you don't register a handler, registering a handler increases code stability and resiliency against possible iOS changes, and can help reduce your code's complexity.

In the same location where you [initialize](#initialization) the SDK, call `registerDeepLinkHandler(_:)` with a closure that handles the URL.

For example:

```swift
import KlaviyoSwift
import KlaviyoForms
...

// Chained with initialization
KlaviyoSDK()
    .initialize(with: "YOUR_KLAVIYO_PUBLIC_API_KEY")
    .registerDeepLinkHandler { url in
        // Your code to parse the URL and use the result to navigate to a specific screen
        // if you created a helper method (see "Adding link-handling logic", above), call it here
    }

// **Or** called separately after initialization
KlaviyoSDK().registerDeepLinkHandler { url in
    // Your code to parse the URL and use the result to navigate to a specific screen
    // if you created a helper method (see "Adding link-handling logic", above), call it here
}
```

#### Step 4: Pass the universal tracking link into the Klaviyo SDK
You need to pass the incoming universal tracking link URL from the `NSUserActivity` object to the Klaviyo SDK by calling the Klaviyo SDK's `handleUniversalTrackingLink(_:)` method. This method returns `true` if the link is a valid Klaviyo universal tracking link. If it returns `false`, the link is not a Klaviyo universal tracking link, and you should handle the non-Klaviyo link as appropriate.

##### If your app uses an AppDelegate
> *See the [next section](#if-you-have-opted-into-scenes) if your app uses a SceneDelegate*

When the user opens a Klaviyo universal tracking link, the system will deliver the link to the AppDelegate's [`application(_:continue:restorationHandler:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiapplicationdelegate/application(_:continue:restorationhandler:)) method. Within the body of this method, you'll need to extract the universal tracking link from the `NSUserActivity`, then pass the link to the Klaviyo SDK by calling `KlaviyoSDK().handleUniversalTrackingLink(<extracted URL>)`.

 This code shows an example of one way to implement the `application(_:continue:restorationHandler:)` method:

```swift
func application(
    _ application: UIApplication,
    continue userActivity: NSUserActivity,
    restorationHandler: @escaping ([UIUserActivityRestoring]?) -> Void
) -> Bool {
    // Get the URL from the incoming user activity.
    guard userActivity.activityType == NSUserActivityTypeBrowsingWeb,
        let incomingURL = userActivity.webpageURL
    else {
        return false
    }

    if KlaviyoSDK().handleUniversalTrackingLink(incomingURL) {
        return true
    } else {
        // handle a link that's not a Klaviyo universal tracking link
        // if you created a helper method (see "Adding link-handling logic", above), call it here
    }
}
```

##### If you have opted into scenes

If your app uses a SceneDelegate, the system delivers the Klaviyo universal tracking link to one of two SceneDelegate methods, depending on the App's state.

If the app is terminated, the system delivers the universal tracking link to the [`scene(_:willConnectTo:options:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/UISceneDelegate/scene(_:willConnectTo:options:)) delegate method after launch.

If the app is running or in the background, the system will deliver the universal tracking link to the [`scene(_:continue:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/UISceneDelegate/scene(_:continue:)) delegate method.

Within the body of *both* of these methods, you'll need to extract the universal tracking link from the `NSUserActivity`, then pass the link to the Klaviyo SDK by calling `KlaviyoSDK().handleUniversalTrackingLink(<extracted URL>)`.

As an example, your implementation may look something like this:

```swift
func scene(
    _ scene: UIScene,
    willConnectTo session: UISceneSession,
    options connectionOptions: UIScene.ConnectionOptions
) {
    // Get the URL from the incoming user activity.
    guard let userActivity = connectionOptions.userActivities.first,
        userActivity.activityType == NSUserActivityTypeBrowsingWeb,
        let incomingURL = userActivity.webpageURL
    else {
        return
    }

    if KlaviyoSDK().handleUniversalTrackingLink(incomingURL) {
        return
    } else {
        // handle a link that's not a Klaviyo universal tracking link
        // if you created a helper method (see "Adding link-handling logic", above), call it here
    }
}

...

func scene(
    _ scene: UIScene,
    continue userActivity: NSUserActivity
) {
    // Get the URL from the incoming user activity.
    guard userActivity.activityType == NSUserActivityTypeBrowsingWeb,
          let incomingURL = userActivity.webpageURL
    else {
        return
    }

    if KlaviyoSDK().handleUniversalTrackingLink(incomingURL) {
        return
    } else {
        // handle a link that's not a Klaviyo universal tracking link
        // if you created a helper method (see "Adding link-handling logic", above), call it here
    }
}
```

### Validation

To validate your deep linking setup, you can send push notifications from the Klaviyo Push editor within the Klaviyo website. You can configure the push notification to trigger a deep link via either a URL scheme or a universal link. When you send the push notification and open it on your mobile device, validate that the link is handled according to the logic you established in ["Adding link-handling logic"](#adding-link-handling-logic).

To validate that Klaviyo universal tracking links are working properly, you'll need to create a test email campaign through the Klaviyo website, and include in the email a universal link matching the scheme you congfigured when you [set up universal links in your Klaviyo account](#configure-universal-links-in-your-klaviyo-account). Send the campaign, and copy the link from the email. Open the link on your mobile device and validate that the link is handled according to the logic you established in ["Adding link-handling logic"](#adding-link-handling-logic).

Additionally, you can locally trigger a deep link using the following command in the terminal:

`xcrun simctl openurl booted {your_URL_here}`

## In-App Forms
> ℹ️ In-App Forms support is available in SDK version [4.2.0](https://github.com/klaviyo/klaviyo-swift-sdk/releases/tag/4.2.0) and higher

[In-App Forms](https://help.klaviyo.com/hc/en-us/articles/34567685177883) are messages displayed to mobile app users while they are actively using an app. You can create new In-App Forms in a drag-and-drop editor in the Sign-Up Forms tab in Klaviyo.  Follow the instructions in this section to integrate forms with your app. The SDK will
display forms according to their targeting and behavior settings and collect delivery and engagement analytics automatically.

Beginning with version 5.0.0, In-App Forms supports advanced targeting and segmentation. In your Klaviyo account, you can configure forms to target or exclude specific lists or segments, and the form will only be shown to users matching those criteria, based on their profile identifiers configured via the [`KlaviyoSDK().set(...)` methods](https://github.com/klaviyo/klaviyo-swift-sdk/blob/61e64552ad2acb65985e9305ae56eb57ff38d28b/Sources/KlaviyoSwift/Klaviyo.swift#L69-L135).

### Prerequisites

* Using Klaviyo SDK version 4.2.0 and higher
* Imported `KlaviyoSwift` and `KlaviyoForms` SDK modules and adding it to the app target.
* We strongly recommend using the latest version of the SDK to ensure compatibility with the latest In-App Forms features. The minimum SDK version supporting In-App Forms is `4.2.0`, and a feature matrix is provided below. Forms that leverage unsupported features will not appear in your app until you update to a version that supports those features.
* Please read the [migration guide](MIGRATION_GUIDE.md) if you are upgrading from 4.2.0-4.2.1 to understanding changes to In-App Forms behavior.

| Feature            | Minimum SDK Version |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| Basic In-App Forms | 4.2.0+              |
| Time Delay         | 5.0.0               |
| Audience Targeting | 5.0.0               |

### Setup

To configure your app to display In-App Forms, call `Klaviyo.registerForInAppForms()` after initializing the SDK with your public API key. Once registered, the SDK may launch an overlay view at any time to present a form according to its targeting and behavior settings configured in your Klaviyo account.

For the best user experience, we recommend registering after any splash screen or loading animations have completed. Depending on your app's architecture, this might be in your AppDelegate's `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` method.

```swift
import KlaviyoSwift
import KlaviyoForms
...

// if registering in the same location where you're initializing the SDK
KlaviyoSDK()
    .initialize(with: "YOUR_KLAVIYO_PUBLIC_API_KEY")
    .registerForInAppForms()

// if registering elsewhere after `KlaviyoSDK` is initialized
KlaviyoSDK().registerForInAppForms()
```

Note that the In-App Forms will automatically respond if/when the API key and/or the profile data changes. You do not need to re-register.

#### In-App Forms Session Configuration

A "session" is considered to be a logical unit of user engagement with the app, defined as a series of foreground interactions that occur within a continuous or near-continuous time window. This is an important concept for In-App Forms, as we want to ensure that a user will not see a form multiple times within a single session.

A session will time out after a specified period of inactivity. When a user launches the app, if the time between the previous interaction with the app and the current one exceeds the specified timeout, we will consider this a new session.

This timeout has a default value of 3600 seconds (1 hour), but it can be customized. To do so, pass an `InAppFormsConfig` object to the `registerForInAppForms()` method. For example, to set a session timeout of 30 minutes:

```swift
import KlaviyoForms
// e.g. to configure a session timeout of 30 minutes
let config = InAppFormsConfig(sessionTimeoutDuration: 1800)
KlaviyoSDK().registerForInAppForms(configuration: config)
```

### Unregistering from In-App Forms

If at any point you need to prevent the SDK from displaying In-App Forms, e.g. when the user logs out, you may call:

```swift
import KlaviyoForms
KlaviyoSDK().unregisterFromInAppForms()
```

Note that after unregistering, the next call to `registerForInAppForms()` will be considered a new session by the SDK.

## Additional Details

### Sandbox Support

> ℹ️ Sandbox support is available in SDK version [2.2.0](https://github.com/klaviyo/klaviyo-swift-sdk/releases/tag/2.2.0) and higher

Apple has two environments with push notification support - Production and Sandbox.
The Production environment supports sending push notifications to real users when an app is published in the App Store or TestFlight.
In contrast, Sandbox applications that support push notifications are those signed with iOS Development Certificates, instead of iOS Distribution Certificates.
Sandbox acts as a staging environment, allowing you to test your applications in a environment similar to but distinct from Production without having to worry about sending messages to real users.

Our SDK supports the use of Sandbox for push as well.
Klaviyo's SDK will determine and store the environment that your push token belongs to and communicate that to our backend,
allowing your tokens to route sends to the correct environments. There is no additional setup needed.
As long as you have deployed your application to Sandbox with our SDK employed to transmit push tokens to our backend,
the ability to send and receive push on these Sandbox applications should work out-of-the-box.

### SDK Data Transfer
Starting with version 1.7.0, the SDK will cache incoming data and flush it back to the Klaviyo API on an interval.
The interval is based on the network link currently in use by the app. The table below shows the flush interval used for each type of connection:

| Network   | Interval   |
| :-------- | :--------- |
| WWAN/Wifi | 10 seconds |
| Cellular  | 30 seconds |

Connection determination is based on notifications from our reachability service.
When there is no network available, the SDK will cache data until the network becomes available again.
All data sent by the SDK should be available shortly after it is flushed by the SDK.

### Retries
The SDK will retry API requests that fail under certain conditions. For example, if a network timeout occurs, the request will be retried on the next flush interval.
In addition, if the SDK receives a rate limiting error `429` from the Klaviyo API, it will use exponential backoff with jitter to retry the next request.
